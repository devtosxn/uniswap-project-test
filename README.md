# Web3Bridge Week 6 Project II

## Project Description
Hardhat tools with MAINNET FORKING:
- Write a script that interacts with at least two functions on uniswap router contract excluding the one used in class [swapTokensForExactTokens].

- Write a smart contract that does anything you want and deploy it to testnet and also use the script to call a write function in your smart contract.

- Copy and paste the transaction hash inside your script file and push your project to gihub.


The two questions must be in the same hardhat file.
